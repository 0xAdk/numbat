# The prelude

Numbat comes with a special module called `prelude` that is always loaded on
startup (unless `--no-prelude` is specified on the command line). This module
is split into multiple submodules and sets up a useful default environment with
mathematical functions, constants but also dimension definitions, unit
definitions and physical constants.

You can find the full source code of the standard library
[on GitHub](https://github.com/sharkdp/numbat/tree/master).

This chapter is a reference to the prelude module.
