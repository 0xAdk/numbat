dimension Length
dimension Time
dimension Mass

dimension Speed = Length / Time
dimension Acceleration = Length / Time^2

unit meter: Length
unit second: Time

unit mps: Speed = meter / second

# wrong dimension for acceleration (should be meter / second^2)
unit mpss: Acceleration = meter / second^3
